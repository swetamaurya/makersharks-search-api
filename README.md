**Project Description:**
The Makersharks Search API is a Node.js-based RESTful API designed to help users search for manufacturers on the Makersharks platform based on specific criteria such as location, nature of business, and manufacturing process. This proof of concept (POC) allows buyers to find manufacturers that meet their customized requirements, facilitating the connection between buyers and suppliers. 
The API supports filtering by various parameters and includes pagination to handle large result sets efficiently. Itâ€™s built with scalability in mind, ensuring that as the database of suppliers grows, users can still quickly and easily find the manufacturers they need.

**Setup Instructions:**
git clone https://github.com/swetamaurya/makersharks-search-api.git
cd makersharks-search-api
npm install
nodemon
